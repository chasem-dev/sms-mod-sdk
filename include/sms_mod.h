/* sms_mod.h: the native mod API of the Super Mario Sunshine PC port.
 *
 * A native mod is a shared library (.so, .dll, .dylib) in its own folder
 * under mods/, beside a mod.ini that names it (docs/MODDING.md). The game
 * loads every such mod at start and calls its sms_mod_load with an SmsApi:
 * tables of functions to hear of the game's events, read and change the
 * game, draw over it, read the controllers and keyboard, keep settings, and
 * talk to other mods. A mod needs nothing but this header to build: it links
 * against nothing of the game's, so one build of a mod runs with every build
 * of the game that has the same major API version.
 *
 * Rules that keep several mods working together:
 *   - Every function is called on the game thread, inside the game's own
 *     steps (the log is the one function any thread may call). Do the slow
 *     work on threads of your own and hand results over.
 *   - Events reach each mod in priority order; an event's documentation says
 *     whether a handler may change its payload, cancel it, or consume it.
 *   - Draw only inside SMS_EV_DRAW. Take screen space from draw->hud_slot, so
 *     panels of different mods stack instead of overlapping.
 *   - Take the controllers and keyboard (input->capture) only while a menu of
 *     yours is open, and bind keys through input->bind_key, which reports
 *     clashes with the port's keys and other mods'.
 *   - Pointers the game hands you (SmsObject, payload pointers) are good for
 *     the call, and objects until the stage changes. Copy what you keep.
 *
 * Compatibility: the tables only grow at their ends, and each starts with its
 * size as the game built it, so a mod built against a newer minor version
 * checks a function is there with SMS_API_HAS before calling it. A new major
 * version is an incompatible change; the game refuses mods of another major.
 *
 * Pre-releases: v1.5.0-beta.1, -beta.2, ... lead to v1.5.0. A beta has the
 * next minor version and SMS_MOD_API_PRERELEASE its number; what a beta added
 * may still change before the release, so a mod built against one is rebuilt
 * against the release (the game warns of a mod built against another beta).
